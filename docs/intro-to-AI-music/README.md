# Intro to AI music

This folder contains a notebook that seeks to explain in a non-formal way some concepts around AI Music. 

In order to setup an environment with all the right dependencies, execute the following command:
```bash
conda env create -f intro-to-ai-music-env.yml
```

Then, activate the environment with the command:
```bash
conda activate intro-to-ai-music-env
```

After that, you will be able to run and explore the [intro-to-ai-music](intro-to-ai-music.ipynb) notebook. This notebook shows in a didactic way how can we transform music into a data format that can be used by a machine learning model. 
It also shows how to perform data augmentation using **time transposition** and **pitch transposition**. 
Finally, it shows how to create a "musical language" that can be used as input for training a deep learning model to generate symbolic music.
